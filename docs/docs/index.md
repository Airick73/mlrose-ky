## mlrose-ky: Machine Learning, Randomized Optimization and SEarch

mlrose-ky is a Python package for applying some of the most common randomized optimization and search algorithms to a range of different optimization problems, over both discrete- and continuous-valued parameter spaces.

The original source code (mlrose) was written by Genevieve Hayes and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gkhayes/mlrose).
